I have changed the solution of the task from AngularJS to jQuery, which I feel more familiar with.

The tables are on two separated views now.

The tables allow to by ordering by any column but there is as well default ordering. To make alphabetical ordering I used the callback functions.

The repos and contributors are still both in .json files. The last thing I need to do is to connect the GitHub API to repo table.
