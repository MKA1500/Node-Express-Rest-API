# X-Formation-Repo-s-and-Team-Contributions
Table made with AngularJS, Bootstrap and JSON files as data sources.

The page is responsive. Numbers of contributions and repo's forks are displayed in descending order. 

To make using the table easier, there is a names browser on the top.

Unfortunately I didn't managed to use official GitHub API in this project, so I stored both data sources in .json files.

The page is responsive and the addictional design base on philosophy 'less is more' :)
